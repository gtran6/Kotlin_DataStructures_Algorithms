/*O(n²) time complexity doesn’t have
great performance, but the sorting algorithms in this category are easy to
understand and useful in some scenarios. These algorithms are space-efficient and
only require constant O(1) additional memory space. In this chapter, you’ll look at
the bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort algorithms.*/
