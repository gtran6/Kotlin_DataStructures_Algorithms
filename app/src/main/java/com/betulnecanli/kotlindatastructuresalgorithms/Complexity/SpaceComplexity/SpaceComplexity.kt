//You could rewrite the above function like this:

        }
    }

        // 4
        var currentValue = numbers.max()!!
        for (value in numbers) {
            if (value < currentValue && value > minValue) {
                currentValue = value
            }
        }
        // 5
        for (value in numbers) {
            if (value == currentValue) {
                println(value)
                currentCount += 1
            }
        }
        // 6
        minValue = currentValue
    }
}

//1. Check for the case if the list is empty. If it is, thereâ€™s nothing to print.
//2. currentCount keeps track of the number of print statements made. minValue
//stores the last printed value.
//3. The algorithm begins by printing all values matching the minValue and updates
//the currentCount according to the number of print statements made.
//4. Using the while loop, the algorithm finds the lowest value bigger than minValue
//and stores it in currentValue.
//5. The algorithm then prints all values of currentValue inside the array while
//updating currentCount.
//6. minValue is set to currentValue, so the next iteration will try to find the next
//minimum value.

//The above algorithm only allocates memory for a few variables. Since the amount of
//memory allocated is constant and does not depend on the size of the list, the space
//complexity is O(1).
